# Microbial Abundance Visualization for BV Recurrence Types
This project visualizes the relative abundance of specific OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) over time for patients with Bacterial Vaginosis (BV), based on sequencing data. It focuses on patients labeled with a recurrence type of **No Initial Response**, **Immediate Recurrence**, **Delayed Recurrence**, and **Successful Response**. 

##Dataset
Here we use an edited dataset composed of subject diagnostic information and vaginal microbiota of 132 HIV positive Tanzanian women (including 39 who received metronidazole treatment for BV) with added columns for BV status and Recurrence Type. Original dataset is accessible here.
